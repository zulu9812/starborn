[h1]Starborn: the Improved Voidtouched Habitat Start[/h1]
The Mod that did Voidtouched before PDX did.

Start on a unique habitat - the Orbital City, built above the ruins of your original homeworld.  Build habitats almost anywhere that gain special bonuses and modifiers based on the planet and deposits they are around.  Your species adapted to life on habitats now cannot live on planets anymore, not that you care, who needs to search for habitatable planets when all of the void is habitable to you?  

Build habitats modulally - as you empire starts and resources are a premium you can start smaller and expand when you can, gaining additional decisions to take habitats to larger than anything the normal races can produce.  

Create huge habitats that span solar systems - rather than manage 10 small habitats in 1 system, manage a single habitat that spreads across the available planets in the system.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Start in unique habitat: the orbital city, in orbit around a tomb world, with unique districts that kept your civilisation alive when their world burned
[*] Build habitats around almost any stellar body.
[*] Your adapton to space means your habitats may get additional desposits, buildings or modifiers based on the body type and deposits such as asteroids - great for mining, molten planets - great for alloys, black holes: whole lot of physics research.
[*] Habitat Satelite Complex megastructure lets you expand your habitats to encompass the entire system without having to manage all the individual planets.  Built it around a planet and one of your existing habitats gets a size boost and access to that planets resources.
[/list]
[i]There are lots of other effects for different types of planets and the different orbital deposits, you'll need to discover them in play or read the spoiler post in discussion[/i]

Federations DLC is not required as this is my own work that predates VoidTouched, it has been made voidtouched compatible for ease of playstyles. 

[h1]Gameplay Notes[/h1]
Remember that habitats cost alloys in maintenance!  Starborn builds will have a constant need for more alloy production,

I do not adjust normal habitats so you will have the ability to build normal habitats if you buy the tech.  Those are completely vanilla and I suggest avoiding them, I've not taken them out to try to limit compatibility problems.

By using the Satelite Complex megastructure it is entirely possible to have a habitat that has too many district types to show on the default UI (with the right system you can easily have mining, energy, trade and research districts).  I strongly recommend a UI mod that allows for more districts, I use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic[/url] 

You can try to "cheat" by enacting the fully enlarge habitat decisions and also the construct more habitat decision at once, because there is not an easy way to immediately deactivate one decision based on another being selected (and in progress).  Go on, try it, I dare you.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod makes changes to:
[list]
[*] City District (placement rules only)
[*] habitable_structure scripted trigger
[/list]
So may have compatibility problems with any other mod that changes these, the symptom is seeing regular planet districts for the orbital city instead of its special ones.  A patch can be avoided by using one of the UI overhaul mods that gives a bigger planet district view.

If you have a mod that wants district compatibility, leave a comment and I will have a look.  IT is not compatible with District Overhaul.

[h1]Credit and Thanks[/h1]
The Orbital City ring is from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructures[/url]  and the nature preserve and scavenger districts were inspired by similar ones from their mod.
The building art for come from CGM Planets.
ViolentBeetle on Stellaris Modding Den discord gave me a great deal of help, without which I never would have been able to do the planet and habitat linking

[h1]Future[/h1]
[list]
[*] More events around habitability
[*] More events generally
[*] Stellaris Immortal Compatibility
