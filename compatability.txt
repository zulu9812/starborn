Planetary Diversity:
Needs the starborn compatibility patch

Should be completely compatible.  Most worlds follow standard rules (e.g. habitable worlds give farming), it should be noted that almost all PD worlds are habitable, even the special/unique ones, and thus will by default give farming districts.  There are a few changes outlined below.

 - Crystal world: Farming, no special bonus
 - Floating World: research hab, physics bonus
 - Gaveyard world:  research hab, society bonus
 - Technoorganic world:  research hab, engineering bonus
 - Archive world: research hab, all science bonus

If you think that other classes should have different effects, leave a comment below



Guillis Planetary Modifiers
Fully compatible - however, when habitats spawn, including starborn ones, Guillis PM runs a set of script to add modifiers and a habitat designation based on the local planet, this will often end up with an additional designation being added, particulally to farming planets (so they will also gain the ability to have an astro mine, for example), which could push the starborn district out of view.

There are 2 solutions to this:
Use a UI mod that allows for a bigger planet view so you can see more than 4 districts, either "Bigger Planet View" or "UI Overhaul Dynamic" will work.  Note that the Planetary Diversity Planet Viewer does not and is locked to 4.
A design has been added that lets you remove Mining, energy research or farming designations as appropriate.  Once you enact it your ability to build the erroneous district will go away.



Gigastructures
As both Giga and Starborn both modify the habitable_structure scripted trigger, you need the patch



Dyson Swarm
Needs both the habitable structures patch and the starborn compatability patch as we both modify urban districts and habitable structures trigger.



Realspace
No patch needed as it does not alter urban districts
At the moment real space new worlds do not do anything special, suggestions welcome

[h1]Megastructure[/h1]
Satelite Habitat Complex: Requires you to designate one fully built habitat (size 6) as the target.  You can then build this megastructure around any other planet/star in the system and when completed it will add +6 districts to your targetted habitat and will give access to any special districts or buildings based on the planet it was built around.  It will not give you any bonuses or modifiers for that world though.  It also adds +5% crime and +5 amenities use to the target hab, representing effects of the distributed nature of the habitat.

[h1]Other[/h1]
[list]
[*]2 levels of "add district" decisions acquired from the starbase techs and master builders as you make more efficient use of your habitat (each adds +2).
[*]Decisions that let you turn off the extra districts if you need more UI room
[*]Habitats adapt to changes in habitable world
[*]Refund on habitat alloy upkeep for size 3 and 4 habitats.
[*]Set of edicts let you build habitats at any size between 3 and 6 and with one or both levels of extra districts at starting, to save on your micromanagement.
